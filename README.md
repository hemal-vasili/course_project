Stock Management System – Project & Presentation
Author: Hemal
Course: Introduction to Programming (ITP)
Institution: SAI University, Chennai

🚀 Project Overview
Welcome to the Stock Management System! This project is a user-friendly inventory management tool built in C, intended to automate and simplify product tracking for small-scale businesses, academic use, and programming education. This repository also includes a visually rich animated presentation to showcase both the technical and conceptual aspects of the solution.

✨ Features
Add, View, Search, Update, and Delete Products
Classical CRUD operations wrapped in an interactive menu interface.

Persistent Storage
Enjoy data retention using binary file operations – no information lost between sessions!

Robust Input Handling
Supports multi-word product/company names, with validation to prevent duplicate IDs.

Clean, Modular, and Readable C Code
Functions are clearly separated for maintainability and easy review.

🎯 Why This Project?
Manual inventory management is prone to errors and inefficiency. This system demonstrates how foundational computer science concepts—like data structures, file operations, and control flow—come together to solve real-world problems. It’s ideal for undergraduate learning and makes CRUD principles tangible and engaging.

🎥 Presentation Instructions
Open presentation.html in a browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox recommended).

Use arrow keys or navigation buttons for animations and transitions.

Each slide is designed to be visually appealing, with smooth transitions and highlights for effective presentation.

🛠️ Usage
Compiling the Program:

bash
gcc stock_management_system.c -o stock_management_system
Running the Program:

bash
./stock_management_system
📝 Code Highlights
Struct-based Item Management:
Each product is represented as a struct with ID, name, company, price, and quantity fields.

File Operations:
Binary files store and retrieve all records for durability.

Interactive UI:
A console-based menu for non-technical users, guiding every action.

📈 Learning Outcomes
Mastery of file I/O in C

Command of struct and array manipulation

Modular, maintainable code structure

Confidence presenting technical work both in writing and on stage

🌱 Future Enhancements (Ideas)
GUI front-end for better user interaction

Database (SQL/NoSQL) integration for scaling
